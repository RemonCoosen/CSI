The hardcoded list of users in CSI had a default user with a hardcoded password in the code (unencrypted).
Users can be added to this list just like how you would add objects to a collection; using comma seperated lines.

To gave an example in launcher.js go to line 107 where you see the following code:
				$.users={
					root:$.chash('secretPassword1',$.pwhashkey)
				}
There you can add new lines just like the follwing:
				$.users={
					root:$.chash('secretPassword1',$.pwhashkey),
         				admin:$.chash('secretPassword2',$.pwhashkey),
					user:$.chash('secretPassword3',$.pwhashkey)
				}
For most people this change gave them an error while trying to launch using node. make sure that you commas are in the right spots.
Next you have to exit both the launcher.js instance AND the GeneralServer.js instance and launch them again. if you did all that you'll
see that the error is gone and you can try your new user logins on jsoneditor.html

NOTE: the code as in http://git-csi.coosen.me has the following default root login

USER:         PASSWORD:
root          secretPassword1
